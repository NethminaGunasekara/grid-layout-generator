The **Grid Layout Generator** is a web-based tool created with React and Vite, designed to simplify the creation of CSS grid layouts. It allows users to visually design grids, manage grid areas, and provides options to copy or download the generated HTML and CSS code.

## Features

- **Resizable Grid Layout**: Adjust the number of rows and columns dynamically, and set their sizes using any CSS unit (px, %, fr, etc.).

- **Area Management**:

  - Add new areas by clicking on any cell.
  - Resize, move, or delete areas using the handles or through area options.
  - Rename areas for better identification.

- **Alignment Options**: Customize the alignment of individual areas using `align-self` and `justify-self` properties.

- **Code Generation**:
  - Copy the code to your clipboard.
  - Download the code as a file for future use.
